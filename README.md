# Plotting-an-Analog-signal-temperature-
-C codes-(ARM CORTEX M4 TM4C123G microcontroller) 
used to read and process an analog signal(temperature value, but can be another analog signal) from PE3 and then Sending it to PC using Serial port-UART through PA0 PA1 
-C# code-(Windows form application) 
written to read a discrete signal from serial port,process and plot it
